Project set during the winter break at the School of Code, Bootcamp 8, 2021. We were asked to "build something". I chose to create a rock paper scissors game to help me remember some of the basics of JavaScript which we learned at the beginning of the Bootcamp. I wanted to make this one part of a larger app, designed to help people make decisions. The idea is that when the user can't make a decision, they put two choices into input fields, then choose rock, paper, or scissors. One choice is assigned to the user, the other to the computer. Whoever wins the rock paper scissors game determines which decision wins. I would later like to add other features, such as a coin flip, a dice roll, and a card game.

Basic development

One page site - Rock Paper Scissors
2 input fields with H3 headers above
    - Take in the two choices the user is trying to decide between
    - One is assigned to the computer, one is assigned to the user.
3 icons
    - A rock
    - Sheet of paper
    - Scissors
User clicks on their choice of the 3 icons.
User clicks on a "play" button.
Computer move is randomly generated.
A winner is called
    - 3 icons disappear and text appears announcing either:
        : YOU WIN! ... beats ... 
        : YOU LOSE! ... beats ...
    - The choice is made and displayed at the top of the screen.
Below the winner being called is a "play again" button


Next iteration
Homepage with selection of simple "choice calling" games
    - Rock, paper, scissors (as above)
    - Flip a coin
    - Roll a dice
